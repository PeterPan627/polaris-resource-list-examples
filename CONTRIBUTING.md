## How to contribute to Polaris resource list examples

ðŸ’Ÿ ðŸŒˆ Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Weâ€™re currently accepting contributions for:

- Bugs and bug fixes
- New resource list examples, especially new resource list items
- Improvements to the project setup

#### Bugs

- **First, check that the bug wasnâ€™t already reported**. Search on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-resource-list-examples/issues).
- If you canâ€™t find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-resource-list-examples/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** demonstrating the expected behavior.

#### Bug fixes

- Open a new GitHub pull request with your fix.
- Ensure the PR description clearly explains the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### Additions and enhancements

- Open a new GitHub pull request with your additions.
- For enhancements to existing examples, ensure the PR description explains your rationale. We prefer rationales grounded in real-world use cases.
- For new examples, explain the use case (preferrably from a real application) and how the example addresses it.
- Weâ€™re committed to making these examples accessible and widely applicable. For this reason weâ€™re not accepting improvements to the project setup that arenâ€™t supported by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Have questions about using the resource list component?

- Ask any question about this component by [opening an issue on the main Polaris repository](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues)

Thanks! ðŸ’œ ðŸ’œ ðŸ’œ
